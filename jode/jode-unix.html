<h1>Step by Step</h1>

You need java version 1.1 or higher.  In the following description I
assume you have the JDK 1.1, residing in <code>/usr/lib/java</code>.
For other installations you have to adopt the paths.  Also I use the
bourne shell syntax.

<ol>
<li> Set the classpath.  It should include the jode_cls.zip as well as
    the directory where the class files you want to decompile resides.
    You can also specify a zip file instead of a directory.  It is
    also a good idea to include the zip resp. jar file containing the
    basic <code>java.*</code> class files.
<pre>
export CLASSPATH=$HOME/jode_cls.zip:$HOME/download:/usr/lib/java/lib/classes.zip
</pre>
</li>
<li> Now you can start the graphical interface as following (Note the
    case of the parameter)
<pre>    
java jode.JodeWindow
</pre>
</li>
<li> The classpath field should already contain the classpath you set
    above.  The class field contains <code>jode.JodeWindow</code> and
    you may push start immediately to decompile this class.
</li>
<li> If you want to decompile your own <code>.class</code> file, enter
    the name of the file without <code>.class</code> extension and
    push the start button.  Change the class path if it doesn't point
    to the right directory.
</li>
<li> After decompiling, you can save the file using the save button.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Packaged classes</h1>

If the class file belongs to a package (like jode.JodeWindow) you
have to give the full qualified class name (the package names
separated by a dot followed by the class name).  The class path should
point to the directory containing the package sub directories in this
case. <br><br>

<h1>Command line utility</h1>

There is also a command line utility which is much more powerful, but
also more difficult to use.  You can start it (after setting the
classpath) with
<pre>
java jode.Decompiler
</pre>
and get a list of the supported parameters.  To decompile the whole
decompiler you can use these magic lines:
<pre>
mkdir src
CLASSPATH=jode_cls.zip java jode.Decompiler --dest src \
  `unzip -v jode_cls.zip|grep .class|cut -c59-|sed s/.class//|sed s?/?.?g`
</pre>

<h1>Obfuscator</h1>

So you want to protect your classes from decompiling?  Well that is
your choice.  You may use my obfuscator.  The class files are
decompileable again (except when using -strong option, but this is
reversable by obfuscating again), but at least the information about
the names of identifiers are completely lost. <br><br>

The obfuscator is quite difficult to use (this is why I hided this
section here) and there is only a short description of the command
line parameters:
<pre>
CLASSPATH=jode_cls.zip java jode.Obfuscator
</pre>

As a hint, to obfuscate the obfuscator use the following command line:
<pre>
CLASSPATH=jode_cls.zip java jode.Obfuscator \
  -cp jode_cls.zip:/usr/lib/java/lib/classes.zip -d obfuscated.zip \
  -weak -revtable translate.tbl -swaporder \
  -preserve jode.Obfuscator.main jode
</pre>

The options <code>-unique</code> and <code>-table</code> can be
helpful to deobfuscate obfuscated code.
