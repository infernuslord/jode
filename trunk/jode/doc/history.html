<h2>Why did I wrote it?</h2> 

<p>Someday I found <code>guavad</code>, a disassembler for java byte
code (it does similar things like <code>javap&nbsp;-c</code>).  I used
it on a class file, and found that it was possible to reconstruct the
original java code.  First I did it by hand on some small routines,
but I soon realized that it was a rather stupid task, and that I could
write a <a href="dasm_to_java.perl"><code>perl</code> script</a>
that does the same.  At the end of the next day I had a working
decompiler.</p>

<p>Now while it was working, it was not easy to use.  You had to
decompile the code first with a disassembler, cut the method, you
wanted to decompile and then run the perl script on it.  So I decided
to get some information of the class files and do this all
automatically.  I decided to write it in <code>java</code> now,
because it suited best.</p>

<p>Just for the records: the java code is now more than 50 times
bigger than the original perl script and is still growing.</p>
