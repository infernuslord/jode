<h1>Step by Step</h1>

You need java version 1.1 or higher.  I suggest using the Sun JDK or
JRE 1.1 or 1.2.  In the following description I assume Sun JDK 1.2,
for other virtual machines the paths and the name of the java
interpreter (<code>c:\jdk1.2\java</code>) may differ. <br><br>

<ol>
<li> Set the classpath.  It should include the jode_cls.zip as well as
    the directory where the class files you want to decompile resides.
    You can also specify a zip file instead of a directory.  It is
    also a good Idea to include the zip resp. jar file containing the
    basic <code>java.*</code> class files.
<pre>
set CLASSPATH=c:\temp\jode_cls.zip;c:\temp;c:\jdk1.2\jre\lib\rt.jar
</pre>
</li>
<li> Now you can start the graphical interface as following (Note the
    case of the parameter)
<pre>    
c:\jdk1.2\java jode.JodeWindow
</pre>
</li>
<li> The classpath field should already contain the classpath you set
    above.  The class field contains <code>jode.JodeWindow</code> and
    you may push start immediately to decompile this class.
</li>
<li> If you want to decompile your own <code>.class</code> file, enter
    the name of the file without <code>.class</code> extension and
    push the start button.  Change the class path if it doesn't point
    to the right directory.
</li>
<li> After decompiling, you can save the file using the save button.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Packaged classes</h1>

If the class file belongs to a package (like jode.JodeWindow) you
have to give the full qualified class name (the package names
separated by a dot followed by the class name).  The class path should
point to the directory containing the package sub directories in this
case. <br><br>

<h1>Command line utility</h1>

There is also a command line utility which is much more powerful, but
also more difficult to use.  You can start it (after setting the
classpath) with
<pre>
c:\jdk1.2\java jode.Decompiler
</pre>
and get a list of the supported parameters.
