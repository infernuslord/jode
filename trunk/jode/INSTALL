Before installing, make sure you have a java compiler (e.g javac or
jikes) and the java 1.1 runtime class library installed.  If you want
to run this program you need at least a 1.1 compatible java virtual
machine.  There are some bugs in javac included in the SUN JDK 1.1, it
won't work.

This package was designed to use the GNU standard for configuration
and makefiles.  To build and install do the following:

0).  If you have downloaded the code from the CVS repository create
configure and Makefile.in with autoconf-2.13 and automake-1.4.  Type
"aclocal; automake -a; autoconf".

1).  You need a java development kit (at least version 1.1), some unix
tools and some java packages.  Make sure that you have all java
packages that are needed in your classpath.  This are gnu.getopt, and
if you have JDK 1.1 you also need the collection classes and swing for
1.1.  These packages are accessible from the following urls:

 CYGWIN (unix tools for win95/NT):
   http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/

 JDK 1.1:

 Collection classes and Swing for JDK 1.1:
   http://java.sun.com/beans/infobus/#DOWNLOAD_COLLECTIONS
   http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/index.html#download-swing

 JDK 1.2:
   http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/index.html

 Getopt:

2).  Run the "configure" script to configure the package.  There are
various options you might want to pass to configure to control how the
package is built.  "configure --help" will give a complete list.  

Use the --with-java option to specify the install directory of the jdk.

If you have jikes, you should specify it with --with-jikes.  You can
give a path to the directory where it resides, otherwise it is
searched in the path.

3).  Type "make" to build the package.

4).  Type "make install" to install the package.  This doesn't work yet.
