Before installing, make sure you have a java compiler (e.g javac or
jikes) and the java 1.1 runtime class library installed.  If you want
to run this program you need at least a 1.1 compatible java virtual
machine.  There are some bugs in javac included in the SUN JDK 1.1, it
won't work.

This package was designed to use the GNU standard for configuration
and makefiles.  To build and install do the following:

1).  Make sure that you have all libraries that are needed in you
classpath.  You need gnu.getopt, and if you have JDK 1.1 you also need
the collection classes and swing for 1.1.

2).  Run the "configure" script to configure the package.  There are
various options you might want to pass to configure to control how the
package is built.  "configure --help" will give a complete list.  

If you have jikes, you should specify it with --with-jikes.  You can
give a path to the directory where it resides, otherwise it is
searched in the path.

3).  Type "make" to build the package.  If you don't have jikes, you
should make clean first, since the dependency problem is not yet
resolved.

4).  Type "make install" to install everything.  This doesn't work yet.

The created jar file is stored in the share directory.
